# Python and Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform, and it can be used for many things, aside from Python.

Think of Python as the language you are writing in, and Jupyter as the pen and pencil. This is how Python and Jupyter are used together.

# Functions

- define function using def

def add(x,y):
    answer = x + y
    return answer
    
- package random

import random
randomlist = random.sample(range(0,101),50) #sampling from 0 to 100 
randomlist

- package numpy

import numpy as np 
np.mean(randomlist)

- package statistics

import statistics as st
st.median(randomlist)

np.var(randomlist)   #var function is not in package statistcs
np.std()  # also 

# Variables
